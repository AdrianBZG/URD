\arguments{
\item{object}{An URD object}

\item{pseudotime}{(Character) Pseudotime to use for building tree}

\item{tips.use}{(Character vector) Name of tips to use in the final tree (Default is NULL, which uses all tips.) Currently, these should all be numeric -- the tree building function will fail otherwise.}

\item{divergence.method}{(Character: "ks" or "preference") Test to use to determine whether visitation has diverged for each pseudotime window.}

\item{cells.per.pseudotime.bin}{(Numeric) Approximate number of cells to assign to each pseudotime bin for branchpoint finding.}

\item{bins.per.pseudotime.window}{(Numeric) Width of moving window in pseudotime used for branchpoint finding, in terms of bins.}

\item{minimum.visits}{(Numeric) Minimum number of random walk visits to a cell to retain it in the tree}

\item{visit.threshold}{(Numeric) Cells are considered potential members for segments/tips from which random walks visited them 
at least this fraction of their maximum visitation from a single tip}

\item{save.breakpoint.plots}{(Path) Path to save plots summarizing (default is NULL, which does not save plots as they are somewhat slow)}

\item{save.all.breakpoint.info}{(Logical) Should all information about breakpoints be stored in the object for use in diagnostic plots? (Can add several hundred MB to object size.)}

\item{p.thresh}{(Numeric) p-value threshold to use in determining whether visitation is significantly different from pairs of tips}

\item{min.cells.per.segment}{(Numeric) Segments with fewer assigned cells weill be collapsed during tree construction}

\item{min.pseudotime.per.segment}{(Numeric) Segments shorter than this in pseudotime will be collapsed during tree construction}

\item{dendro.node.size}{(Numeric) Number of cells to assign per node (used for averaging expression for tree dendrogram branch coloring)}

\item{dendro.cell.jitter}{(Numeric) For the dendrogram tree layout, how much jitter to apply to cells. This can be revised after building the tree by re-generating the cell layout using \code{\link{treeLayoutCells}} with a different parameter.}

\item{dendro.cell.dist.to.tree}{(Numeric) For the dendrogram tree layout, how far to push cells away from the dendrogram branches. This can be revised after building the tree by re-generating the cell layout using \code{\link{treeLayoutCells}} with a different parameter.}

\item{verbose}{(Logical) Report on progress?}
