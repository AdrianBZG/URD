# URD

**URD** is an R package designed for reconstructing transcriptional trajectories underlying specification or differentiation processes in the form of a branching tree, using single cell RNA-sequencing data. It is named after the [Norse mythological figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdr) who nurtures the world tree and decides all fates.
